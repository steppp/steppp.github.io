<p>
If you <strong>really</strong> want to know something about me, I can tell you
that my name is Stefano, and I'm from Italy üáÆüáπ.
</p>

<p>
I love programming and everything related to PCs and things that you can run
code on.
I am currently studying Computer Science at UniBo (almost finished) and I have
some experience in various tech stacks/frameworks/languages.
Some of these include:

<ul>
<li>iOS programming: Swift, SwiftUI and a bit of Objective-C</li>
<li>Web pages: Angular, Javascript, Typescript, CSS, HTML, a bit of Vue</li>
<li>OS: C kernel programming, Python, Java, C++, C#</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Speaking of something else, I also like videogames, movies, rock/metal music.
Avid coffee drinker and lover of good food üçï.

This is the <code>CSS</code> used to show the separator under the navigation bar:
{% highlight css %}
nav::after {
  content: " ~ ";
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0px 5%;
  margin-top: $nav-sep-height;
  height: 0.1rem;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  font-family: $mono-font;
  color: #ccc;
  line-height: 0.2rem;

  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, $content-bg-col, #ddd 15% 45%, $content-bg-col 45% 55%, #ddd 55% 85%, $content-bg-col);
}
{% endhighlight %}
